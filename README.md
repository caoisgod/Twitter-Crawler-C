# Twitter-Crawler-C
Today, there are many online social media platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, News
Websites etc.) which allow users to post/share information daily. The data generated in the social
media platforms contains valuable information. Many companies have invested a large amount of
money analysing the social media data to extract the insight and provide meaningful information to
their customers. As a solution provider, your team aims to develop a C++ application to provide
useful information over the social media data. In this project, you will learn and enhance various skills
such as data crawling, data integration/analysis, application development and data visualization,
which are highly demanded by the industry
